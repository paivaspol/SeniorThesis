\begin{abstract}
Visually impaired people uses touchscreen on smartphone with screen reader. The user uses audio feedback from the screen reader to navigate the phone. Since this method requires a lot of attention to the audio, it is difficult to use in a noisy setting. We introduce DigiTaps, an eyes-free number entry method that uses minimal voice feedback. Users can enter digits by tap or swipe anywhere on the screen. The digits are represented by two different DigiTaps codes. We conducted a preliminary study to compare DigiTaps method to the screen reader method. The participants achieved a significantly lower error rate by using DigiTaps method than using the screen reader method. To conduct a more rigorous study, we develop DigiTaps game. DigiTaps game is a number entry game designed for conducting user studies in the large. We made it available on the Apple App Store. We use it as a platform to collect the playersâ€™ data such as touch events and game playing statistics. With the data collected, we plan to analyze the data to look for interesting information and evaluate the two methods.
